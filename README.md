# Labanal - Laboratory Analysis Management System

## Overview
Labanal is a management system for a medical analysis laboratory. It provides a structured solution for handling blood sample analysis, patient appointments, and staff management. The system consists of multiple components tailored for different user roles.

## Features
### External Web Application (Patients)
- User authentication (sign-up/login)
- Appointment booking
- Access to analysis results

### Internal Web Application (Lab Staff)
- **Secretaries**: Register new patients, manage appointments, and access results.
- **Nurses**: Log patient blood samples into the system.
- **Head Doctor**: Manage lab personnel, monitor statistics, and oversee operations.

### Java Application (Technicians)
- Authentication system for lab technicians.
- View and process pending blood samples.
- Manage sample status and processing.

### C++ Application (Analysis Processing)
- Implements algorithms to generate sample analysis results.
- Processes blood sample data for result generation.
- Stores generated results in a structured format.

## Tech Stack
- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript (for UI and interactivity)
- **Backend**: PHP (for handling logic and database interactions)
- **Database**: MySQL (for storing patient, appointment, and analysis data)
- **Java**: Used for technician operations
- **C++**: Used for blood analysis data processing
