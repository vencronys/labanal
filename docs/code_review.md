# Labanal Project - Code Review Guidelines

This document outlines the process and best practices for conducting code reviews in the Labanal project. Code reviews are essential to ensure code quality, maintainability, and consistency across the project.

## Purpose of Code Reviews
- **Improve code quality**: Catch bugs, enhance readability, and ensure consistency.
- **Knowledge sharing**: Promote learning and sharing between team members.
- **Maintain coding standards**: Ensure adherence to the project's coding style guide.

## Code Review Process

### 1. **Opening a Pull Request (PR)**
- Open a PR against the `dev` branch.
- The PR title should be descriptive (e.g., `feat: Add appointment booking functionality`).
- Include a description in the PR body with:
  - What was changed and why.
  - A reference to any relevant issue or task.
  - A summary of testing done (if applicable).

### 2. **Review Checklist**
The reviewer should check the following items during the code review:
- **Code quality**: Is the code clean and easy to understand? Are there any redundant or unnecessary lines of code?
- **Functionality**: Does the code work as expected? Are there any potential bugs or edge cases?
- **Security**: Are sensitive data (like passwords) handled securely? Is the code protected against common security vulnerabilities (e.g., SQL injection)?
- **Style and conventions**: Does the code adhere to the project's coding style guide?
- **Test coverage**: Are there any existing tests? If not, does the feature require tests?
- **Documentation**: Are functions, methods, and classes well-documented? Is the overall documentation up-to-date?

### 3. **Review Feedback**
- Provide **constructive feedback**. Be clear, respectful, and specific.
- If something is unclear, ask for clarification rather than making assumptions.
- Use comments in the PR to explain why certain changes are requested.

### 4. **Approval**
- Once the code passes review and any necessary changes are made, approve the PR.
- Ensure that the code compiles and passes all relevant tests before approving.
- Merge the PR once it is approved by at least one reviewer.

### 5. **Post-Merge**
- After merging, ensure that the branch is deleted to keep the repository clean.

## When to Reject a PR
- The code introduces significant functionality but lacks adequate testing.
- The code does not follow the project's style guide or conventions.
- The feature or bug fix does not meet the requirements or functionality as described.
- Critical issues are discovered that need to be resolved before merging.
